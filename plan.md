### Uni C# project

Have to make a piece of software which has genuine usage for my company (ACN), looking to emulate car parking system for offices. 
- choose user type (security/employee)

- for employee, options (starting work/leaving work)

- starting work - enter car registration & ID
- car is "parked". 
- when parking spaces have ran out, choose which car the newly parked car is blocking in (actually happens) 
- thank you! 

- leaving work - enter car registration
- car is "free/blocked". 
- if blocked, user given car registration it is blocked by and told to contact security

- security - can add car registration, check blocked by, notify staff member giving ID (won't actually do anything) 
- repeating menu (add cars, who's parked etc., clear data)
- see all cars parked in list ( and ones blocking ) 
- remove car registrations (person left work without chance to it) 
- clear db (file), day has ended.

# Uni spec

# Windows Form Application (60%) 

1. It must be Forms based, with appropriate user interaction and input validation.
2. It must demonstrate the use of variables, including constants.
3. It must have an appropriate flow of control, through the use of repetition, and selection.
4. It must be a multi-function application.
5. It must allow users to add, display and edit data.
6. It must demonstrate data persistence through saving / reading data to / from to a file.
7. It must demonstrate your ability to develop application logic, for example through: Mechanisms for ensuring duplicate data cannot be added, Mechanisms for sorting, filtering and displaying data, Mechanisms for ensuring a finite number of data entries can be added, or, Development of a multi-user system (for example a system that provides different functionality for users with different access privileges.)

# Meeting above spec 

1. Will start with button for which type of user it is (Security/Employee), using form inputs/outputs/buttons to enter, edit, see and remove data.
2. Variables will be neeeded in program as per usual but CONST will be things like car parking spaces, maximum cars in lot)
3. flow will be controlled by user type selection, giving appropriate options, repeating menu and using data from that "day" - file will be cleared by "security" at the end of the day. 
4. put in cars as parked, check if they're blocked, clear data etc.
5. add cars parked, car parked blocked by, display all parked cars and who's blocked by who, edit cars parked / blocked by
6. file i/o will be used for data
7. will use limited loops and consts to limit data entered. will sort, fitler and display data using i/o methods. multi-user system.

# Requirements Analysis & System Design (30%)

User Requirements Specification (10%) 
Write a short requirements specification (approx. 250 words) from a clientâ€™s perspective of the proposed system. This should include a simple description of the purpose of the system, a list of functional requirements and a list of non-functional requirements.

PACT Analysis (10%) 
Your PACT analysis should identify and prioritise the people using your system, the activities that your system should automate, the context of application use, and relevant technologies, including input / output mechanisms.

System Flow Chart (10%) 
Draw a flow chart to illustrate the program flow / algorithm you are going to develop. Remember this means breaking down the problem into chunks (functional decomposition), then considering not only each sub-problem but also the relationships between them - what order do they need to happen in? Can they happen at the same time, or even in reverse? If one sub-problem fails, does it prevent the main problem from being realised? All of this means that your flow chart will show terminals, inputs, outputs, sequences, selections/decisions (if statements), calculations perhaps using iteration/repetition (loops) and any other operations you choose to use.
